Easiest way - accessed and modified will be the same:

touch -a -m -t 201512180130.09 fileName.ext

Where:

-a = accessed
-m = modified
-t = timestamp - use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] time format

If you wish to use NOW just drop the -t and the timestamp.

To verify they are all the same: stat fileName.ext
